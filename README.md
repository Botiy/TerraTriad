  In our task, the goal is to locate ships in images, and put an aligned bounding box segment around the ships you locate. Many images do not contain ships, and those that do may contain multiple ships. Ships within and across images may differ in size (sometimes significantly) and be located in open sea, at docks, marinas, etc. 
  ### Milestone 1 - The name of the file, which you have to run: 
  AirbusShipDetection.ipynb
  
  Authorization requires a kaggle json file - in our project this file is also present.

  ### Milestone 2 - The EfficientLoading.ipynb contains the splitting, balancing and loading of the dataset. It uses an ImageDataGenerator for augmenting the images. 
  ### The Model.ipynb is the notebook, which contains our initial model, implementing a U-net architecture. 
  ### To evaluate the results with different metrics the Evaluation.ipynb should be ran.
